1. This week I learned about using Queues in different ways
and how it can be utilized to make the program faster

2. I really enjoyed the finished product of this program. 
I really enjoyed how the program was very interactive and 
I now had an instrument I can carry around for fun at all times

3. I thought the most frustrating part was trying to tell myself
it was ok to not understand the physics and science behind
soundwaves but still trying to code about it without understanding it.

4. I found the spec very very helpful and the test programs very helpful for this week
because after careful reading through the spec, it became clear and almost 
as if the spec was telling me step-by-step what to do. Also the test programs showed me
exactly where I may have made a mistake.
